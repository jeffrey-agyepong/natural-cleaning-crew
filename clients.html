      <h2 class="center">NANCY AND MAX B.</h2>
      <p>Over the past 6 years, we have tried several cleaning crews and Natural Cleaning Crew is by far, the best! They
        are a wife & husband team by the name of Rebekah & Jethro de Beer. They have worked for us for about a year and
        do
        a fantastic job cleaning our home. Their pricing is affordable & fair-priced and their communication skills are
        respectable & focused. In the past, one of the problems we have had has been getting other cleaning crews to
        show
        up when they were supposed to & it has been just the opposite with Rebekah & Jethro. <br> They are always on
        time and
        send out a reminder a day or two ahead to make sure that the assigned date & time still work. They are very
        reliable & trustworthy towards us as well as towards our possessions. Being very health-conscious, they use 99%
        all-natural products & cleaning methods. Rebekah & Jethro are willing to do extra, if asked, and to make sure
        that
        we are satisfied with what is asked of them. Although young, they are a hard-working couple who aim to please
        and
        we trust them completely! Please consider them if you are looking for someone energetic & who can do a
        spectacular
        cleaning job in your home or office</p>

      <p>We have been using Rebekah and her partner for quite a few months now and are happy to recommend them! They are
        reliable, pleasant and we felt they were very fair with pricing too. Great with pets and use natural cleaning
        products.</p>

      <p>Rebekah and Jethro have cleaned for me for 2 years. I sometimes use them monthly but may need them more often
        depending on my schedule. They have always been able to clean anytime I have requested. They are willing to do
        extra if needed. Very fair priced. I trust them entirely and usually leave to run errands while they clean. Very
        good and sweet couple.</p>

      <p>I recommend Rebekah de Beer most highly for your housecleaning needs. She is an excellent communicator,
        extremely trustworthy and thorough, and always aims to please her customers. I also love that she brings her own
        equipment and cleaning products.</p>
