          <h2>HOUSE AND OFFICE CLEANING</h2>
          <h2>Expert Service</h3>
            <p>Our primary service is making your home or office spotless from top to bottom, with a health-conscious
              mindset. We know how detrimental the standard harsh chemicals used in cleaning products are, and the
              health
              problems they can cause. The owner herself is allergic to most normal cleaners, and that is what sparked
              the
              desire to bring safe cleaning to others. For details on what we do, click below.</p>

          We have asked Rebekah to clean our 4000 sq ft house after we sold it and moved out. She brought in her team
          and in five hours the house was ready for the new owners to move in. 20 years of dust on the window blinds and
          floor skirtings were gone!</p>
        <p>After this experience we requested her to put our next house on her schedule for a monthly clean. She has now
          come in for a bit more than a year and it is remarkable what she accomplish in a few hours. Rebekah brings her
          own environment friendly cleaning supplies and professional equipment to work with. She is always ready to
          walk the extra mile for us, she has noticed the kitchen floor needs a thorough cleaning as well as the
          bathroom floors. The floors are now looking totally different!

          She is very reasonable with her pricing, so much so that we gave her a bonus for the work she has done.</p>
        <p>We wish her good luck in her further endeavors and know she will succeed.</p>
