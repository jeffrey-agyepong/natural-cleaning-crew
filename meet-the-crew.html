            always had steady clientele and has seen every job through. Her now husband, Jethro, joined her after the
            first year and has been working with her since. They have been working as a team, developing a highly
            efficient method of cleaning.</p>

            time she enjoys spending time with family, practising cello, and playing with her cats.</p>
